# Changelog

Every release of Neru. The app shows the same notes in *What's new* after it updates. Downloads are on the [releases page](https://github.com/DiaeEddineJamal/Neru/releases).

## 0.1.0 · The first release
*2026-09-29*

Neru is a local-first coding agent: it explores your project, proposes changes you read line by line, and never acts without asking.

### An agent that works on your project

- Reads, searches, and edits files, and creates, renames, moves, and deletes files and folders — scaffolding whole features file by file.
- Every change shows a diff first and saves a checkpoint, so Undo and Rewind put files and folders back exactly.
- A project tree beside the conversation marks the files Neru just touched.
- Permission modes: review every step, accept edits, plan read-only, auto for routine work, or bypass.

### Free models that can really code

- NVIDIA NIM, ModelScope, Google Gemini, Cerebras, Mistral, and OpenRouter free plans, each with a link to get a key and its daily allowance.
- When a model hits its limit, Neru switches to the next best free coding model and keeps going.
- Model lists put the strongest coding models first. Local models through Ollama, and OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and other keys work too.

### Context that fits

- A live context meter shows the model's real window, the per-request limit of your key, and requests or tokens left today.
- Large files are read in ranges, stale file reads are dropped, long tool output is trimmed, and long sessions are summarized.
- Big connector catalogs load on demand instead of filling every request.

### Calmer, clearer thinking

- Thinking orbs cross-fade between states, and the status text glides with a soft shimmer and a timer.
- Steps appear on a timeline and settle with a check; finished replies recap what was read, created, edited, moved, or run.
- Sessions get a short title that says what you are working on.

### Everything else

- Skills: add Markdown skill files or folders in Settings → Skills. Neru loads a skill when a task matches its description, and /name runs it directly.
- Parallel sessions with Git worktrees, a review pane, pull requests and CI checks, MCP connectors, slash commands, on-device dictation, a terminal, and a preview pane.
- A redesigned onboarding where every control fits on small windows, with arrow-key navigation.
- Branded installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux, and automatic updates from GitHub Releases.
